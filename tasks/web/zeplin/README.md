# For this task I build the design for the page with FAQ's and a form to send in a new question.
## Design from: https://zpl.io/bAMBWy6

I am aware of some of the feautures I am still missing, namely:
1.  the resizer in the textarea is not taking the correct color
2.  every list item should have a circle under its type
3.  if there is text added in the listitems (as in a paragraph for an answer of the question), the list jumps to the left side of the page
4.  the horizontal lines inbetween the list-items are not exactly simalair to the design
